## Unit Testing

### About Unit Tests

The repo has a set of very basic unit tests which realistically only tests the backend compiles. This is because the majority of the functions within the backend rely on a database connection and cannot be tested through basic unit testing. The unit tests test functions such as "nest" that do not need a backend. These tests can be found inside "/backend/__tests__" in a file named "backend.test.jest". Functions created which do not rely on a database connection should be tested inside this file.

### Running Unit Tests

These tests are made using Jest and can be run using the command `npm test` from inside the backend directory.

### Adding to Unit Tests

To add a new test, create a new test function inside the "backend.test.jest" file. Each function should only test one function. Ensure groups of tests are grouped together inside a describe block. This block represents the function being tested. Inside the describe block each test block is a test for the function. Try and keep tests simple and only test one thing at a time.

## Integration Testing

### Running Integration Tests

To run the integration tests, navigate to the "integration_tests" directory and run the command `./run_tests.sh`. This will run all the tests and output the results to the console.

### Adding to Integration Tests

#### Adding to backend tests

When adding new tests for routes. Ensure that basic testing of the success and errors are tested inside the appropriate ".py" file. Ensure tests are written to also test the error handling and returned HTTP code. After this try adding the test into one or more of the scenarios in the "test_full_suite.py" file. The added test should follow the format of the other tests in the file. Tests should have a meaningful name following the format of test_ROUTE_TYPE_MOREINFO. Where ROUTE = route to be tested, TYPE= get, post  etc and MOREINFO = meaningful information about what the test is doing. This will help developers understand what the test is doing and why it is there. Ensure that each tests asserts the returned http code and the returned data. Inside each test if something is unclear, add a comment to explain what is happening.

#### Adding to frontend tests

The easiest way to add tests to the frontend is to use playwrights vscode record feature to record the tests. This will generate the tests for you. After this, you can modify the tests to make them more readable and understandable. The tests should be placed inside the "integration_tests/frontend" directory. Where the filename represents the page type (e.g. test_home_page). To use playwright record please visit [PlayWright](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode).

## GitHub Workflow Actions

### About GitHub Workflow Actions

Currently the unit tests and integration tests are run in the GitHub Actions. This is done on every push or PR to the main branch. The tests are run in parallel to speed up the process. They can also be manually run by clicking the workflow tests and selecting which branch to run the tests on. This will run both the integration and unit tests.

### Running GitHub Workflow Actions

#### Manual Run

To manually run the workflow on your branch navigate to the GitHub Actions tab and select the tests workflow. Then select the branch you want to run the tests on. This will run the tests on the selected branch. This will run both the integration and unit tests.

#### Automatic Run

The tests are run automatically on every push or PR to the main branch. This will run both the integration and unit tests.

## Results of Tests

This section has been added for the marker. For proof and evidence of the tests please visit the GitHub Actions and select the test workflow. Here you will find both the basic unit tests and integration tests being run and their results.
